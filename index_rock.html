                     mineral and rock. What makes a rock different from a mineral. 
                     Letâ€™s find out answers to these questions and other important relevant
                      aspects of rock and mineral.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of quartz sand, but it can also
                contain significant amounts of feldspar, and sometimes silt and clay. Sandstone that contains more than 90% quartz
                is called quartzose sandstone. When the sandstone contains more than 25% feldspar, it is called arkose or arkosic
                sandstone. When there is a significant amount of clay or silt, geologists refer to the rock as argillaceous sandstone.
                The color of sandstone varies, depending on its composition. Argillaceous sandstones are often gray to blue. Because it
                is composed of light colored minerals, sandstone is typically light tan in color. Other elements, however, create colors
                in sandstone. The most common sandstones have various shades of red, caused by iron oxide (rust). In some instances,
                there is a purple hue caused by manganese. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Laterite is both a soil and a rock type rich in iron and aluminium and is commonly
                considered to have formed in hot and wet tropical areas. Nearly all laterites are of rusty-red coloration, because
                of high iron oxide content. They develop by intensive and prolonged weathering of the underlying parent rock, usually
                when there are conditions of high temperatures and heavy rainfall with alternate wet and dry periods.[1] The process
                of formation is called laterization.[2] Tropical weathering is a prolonged process of chemical weathering which
                produces a wide variety in the thickness, grade, chemistry and ore mineralogy of the resulting soils. The majority
                of the land area containing laterites is between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Slate is a fine-grained, foliated, homogeneous, metamorphic rock derived from an
                original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade, regional metamorphism.
                It is the finest-grained foliated metamorphic rock. Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary
                layering, but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression.The foliation in slate,
                called "slaty cleavage", is caused by strong compression in which fine-grained clay forms flakes to regrow in
                planes perpendicular to the compression. When expertly "cut" by striking parallel to the foliation, with a
                specialized tool in the quarry, many slates display a property called fissility, forming smooth, flat sheet
                of stone, which have long been used for roofing, floor tiles, and other purposes.
